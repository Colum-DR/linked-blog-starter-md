The Cold Below is the most feral and primordial force originating from the far realm. It is headed by a mysterious hive mind, who aims to devour existence as we know it, and turn it into their own corrupted domain. 

"The Cold" as some refer to it as, has the ability to corrupt the minds and bodies of all but the most strong willed aberrations. This corruption decreases their self control and ability to plan long term and increases their strength, dexterity, and constitution. Aberrations corrupted this way will also develop inky black areas on their body which seem to eat light, and their eyes, if they have any, will become a toxic neon yellow. Among aberrations, becoming corrupted in this way is referred to as [[Going Cold]].

The Cold Below has a difficult time manifesting in the material plane, and usually will need some form of assistance, thus, it will make deals with native residents of the plane to gain more footing. 

Currently there is a tiny crack on the ocean floor being used as a way for the Cold to seep into the material plane. This crack is also where [[Amu Aau]] has been imprisoned, and though she is quite resistant, The Cold has already begun to take hold of her actions.
