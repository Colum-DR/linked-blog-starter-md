An [[Eye of the Storm]] oneshot that takes place in [[The Stormcleft Archipelago]] before the start of the campaign, in 10 AGR.


Level 8 Oneshot

hired by a pirate captain to look into the disappearance of some of her subordinate ships. These ships were sent out to [[Jaw Reef]] in search of a a rumored artifact which was said to be able to allow a ship to survive a trip through the storm wall. 

This artifact is actually a possession of the powerful undersea Archfey, [[Amu Aau]], who makes the reef her home. She does have an artifact, The [[Whip of the Waves]], which she uses to sink ships which try to sail through her home and damage the reef. She sank the pirates who were searching for her whip and has taken them as thralls. The party must figure out how to make their way through the reef, defeat her, and rescue the pirates. 


To defeat [[Amu Aau]] she must first be put into a poisoned state, using a special draught made from the uninhabitable waters at the center of the [[Deathspit Bayou]], which is full of vile creatures. Then she must be weighed down and placed in a deep, dark brine pool. 

To make the draught, the party will need to convince a group of Sea hags which are disgruntled with [[Amu Aau]] to help them. They will have the party venture to the [[Deathspit Bayou]] to gather the water from the [[Pool of Death]] located at the center. The party must also acquire the venom of a green dragon, and a chunk of pure ice from a mountain peak. With these ingredients the Sea Hags can create the poison, which the party must then figure out how to get [[Amu Aau]] to drink
