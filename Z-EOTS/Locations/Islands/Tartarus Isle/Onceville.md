A run down old mining town, previously inhabited by humans, is now home to sparse amounts of more monstrous races, like lizardfolk and gnolls. 
There's a small market here, as well as a tavern in a partially destroyed building,

Destroyed Tavern: This building once was a simple saloon, however now it has seen its share of years, half the roof is fallen in, and a large boulder sits embedded in one of the sidewalls, there are shanty like extensions which have been added to this building, increasing its strange ramshackle aesthetic. it is run by an orc named Grog, who is a bit of a local loremaster. 

Fishy Market: You enter a large square, sun relentlessly beating down upon you, you see a large amount of stalls with canvass overheads, the smell of fish and meat permeates the air, becoming mildly offensive to your nostrils.
