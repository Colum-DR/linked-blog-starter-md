A reef on the "jaw" of [[Tartarus Isle]]. This reef is a deeply magical place, which is full of humongous coral growths and fey creatures. It was once ruled by [[Amu Aau]], but after the events of the [[Summer Oneshot]], it came under the control of [[Leofaang]], whos presence has caused wild growth of hedges made of seaweed and seagrass. His toxic dragons breath has also caused some of the coral to die off around the palace.
